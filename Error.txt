# Error: Problem Importing `face-recognition`

## Issue:
If you are encountering problems while importing the `face-recognition` library in Python, the most common issue is the lack of necessary C++ build tools or CMake on your system. This library requires compilation of certain C++ dependencies, which means you'll need to install the required build tools and CMake to resolve the issue.

### Solution:

### 1. Install C++ Build Tools
You need to install the **C++ Build Tools** provided by Visual Studio.

#### Steps:
1. Visit the official download page for **Microsoft C++ Build Tools**:  
   [Visual Studio C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
   
2. Download the installer and follow the steps to install the **Desktop development with C++** package. Make sure to check the following components during installation:
   - MSVC (Microsoft C++ Compiler)
   - Windows SDK
   - CMake tools for Windows
   
3. Once the installation is complete, ensure that the environment variables are properly set up by restarting your system.

### 2. Install CMake
CMake is required to build some of the dependencies for `face-recognition`.

#### Steps:
1. Download the latest version of CMake from the official site:  
   [CMake Download Page](https://cmake.org/download/)
   
2. Choose the version compatible with your system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and follow the instructions for installation.

3. After installation, make sure to add CMake to your system's PATH environment variable so that it can be accessed from the command line.

### 3. Reinstall `face-recognition`
Once the C++ Build Tools and CMake are properly installed, reinstall the `face-recognition` package using pip:

```bash
pip install face-recognition
```

This should now install the library without any errors related to missing C++ build tools or CMake.
