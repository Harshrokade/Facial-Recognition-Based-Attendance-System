# Facial Recognition-Based Attendance System

This project is a **Facial Recognition-Based Attendance System** that automates attendance marking using computer vision. The system captures live images or video feed, detects faces, and matches them with a pre-trained facial dataset. Once a match is identified, the system records the attendance, offering an efficient, contactless solution ideal for environments like classrooms, offices, or events.

### Key Features:
- **Real-time Face Detection**: The system uses OpenCV to detect faces in real-time from a camera feed or images.
- **Facial Recognition**: It utilizes pre-trained models such as `face_recognition` or `dlib` to match detected faces with stored user data.
- **Automated Attendance Logging**: Upon successful face recognition, the attendance is logged automatically, and records can be stored in a database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL) or CSV file.
- **Easy Enrollment**: Users can register their facial data by uploading images or capturing them through a webcam.
- **Customizable**: The system is flexible, allowing you to expand it with more cameras and scale the dataset for larger environments.

### Technologies:
- **Python** for the core logic.
- **OpenCV** for image processing and real-time face detection.
- **face_recognition** library for accurate face matching.
- **Flask/Django** (optional) for creating a web interface.
- **SQLite/MySQL** for attendance record storage.

### How It Works:
1. Add users by capturing and storing their facial images.
2. The system processes real-time video or image feeds, detects faces, and compares them to the stored dataset.
3. When a match is found, the attendance for that individual is automatically logged.
4. Attendance reports can be generated and viewed in the system or exported as needed.
