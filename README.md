# Facial-Recognition-Based-Attendance-System
This project is a Facial Recognition-Based Attendance System that automates attendance marking using computer vision. The system captures live images or video feed, detects faces, and matches them with a pre-trained facial dataset. Once a match is identified, the system records the attendance.
